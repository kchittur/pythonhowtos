# pythonhowtos
A collection of Howto's using python.
I discovered python as a powerful programming system to explain several concepts, ideas in chemical engineering.
For example, drawing the McCabe Thiele binary distillation diagram is sometimes difficult for students to understand - 
I created code for that, shared it with the students - demonstrated it in class - it helped. 
I also wrote (and it is here) some detailed notes about studying and understand enzyme kinetics.
I hope to add more to this repository - feel free to contact me at cheprofessor@gmail.com (chitturk@uah.edu also seems to work)
